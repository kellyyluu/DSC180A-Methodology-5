<b> 1. What is the most intersting topic covered in your domain this quarter? </b> \\
The most intereting topic covered in my domain this quarter is the clustering of the activity centers. I thought it was interesting how SANDAG was able to investigate how to cluster the different employment centers through their clustering techniques.

<b> 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project. </b> \\
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is how to use other data sources to investigate the different clusters. I am interested in developing more key insights with the different data sources about the different clusters.

<b> 3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project? </b> \\
A change that I'd make to my Quarter 1 Project is that I would try to look more into how the clusters were developed and read into their techniques on how they were divided and see if I could improve it.

<b> 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project? </b> \\ 
Currently, we are working on more data visualization using their dashboard. I would like to further use Machine Learning techniques in order to look at the relationship between the current data and the different regions that are being grouped together.
